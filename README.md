# TSRSentimentAnalysis

I have made a sentiment analysis program which takes in an input string and scans it for positive adjectives and negative adjectives, it thenreturns a positive score and negative score for the string out of 1 by diving the total number of positive/negative words by the total words recgonized.

Any contribution to the project is welcome.
